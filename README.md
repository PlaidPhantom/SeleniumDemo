3. BasicWebApp.Tests is an MSTest project that uses Selenium to test the functionality of the BasicWebApp project.


## Selenium

http://www.seleniumhq.org/

The website is actually not great at explaining things, but you want "Selenium WebDriver".

[Here](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/) is the actual API documentation.
